# LLM Backend Setup

In order for the API to run the OpenAI API key must be set in the 'OPENAI_API_KEY' environmental variable.

To run build and run with Docker compose a .env file is needed. An example can be found in .env.example which (at the time of writing) looks like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
